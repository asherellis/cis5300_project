    "question": "What specific EU energy measure was scheduled to take effect according to the report, and what key details did member states agree on regarding the scope and level of gas reductions?",
    "answer": "According to the report, EU energy ministers agreed to a voluntary 15% reduction in gas usage over the winter, with the target potentially becoming mandatory if the Kremlin ordered a complete shutdown of gas to Europe. Member states agreed that countries with specific circumstances, such as island nations, countries little connected to the European gas network, and the Baltic states, may be exempt from mandatory cuts or have a reduced savings target.",

    "question": "How did long-term political instability, recurring coups, and the emergence of northern armed groups shape Mali\u2019s struggle to maintain territorial control from 1991 through 2024?",
    "answer": "Mali's struggle to maintain territorial control was significantly hindered by rising ethnic tensions, the influx of fighters from Libya, and the emergence of northern armed groups, particularly terrorist organizations. This led to a rebellion and military coup in 2012, followed by the occupation of the country's three northern regions by rebels, allowing terrorist groups to establish strongholds. Despite a 2013 French-led military intervention, the government's grasp in the region remained weak, and terrorist groups were left out of a 2015 internationally mediated peace accord, resulting in continued violence and instability. The country experienced further instability, with multiple coups and the establishment of a transition government, which ultimately withdrew from the Economic Community of West African States in 2024.",
