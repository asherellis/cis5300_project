    "question": "What disagreements emerged within the European Union regarding proposed gas-use reductions, and which countries argued that they should not have to cut consumption equally?",
    "answer": "The disagreements within the European Union emerged over the proposed gas-use reductions, with Hungary opposing the plan and Hungary's foreign minister, P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3, representing the country in the EU energy ministers' meeting. There were also issues with the exemptions for countries that use less or no Russian gas, leading to a lower final tally than the initially suggested 45bn cubic metres reduction.",

    "question": "How did Oman's leadership under Sultan Qaboos manage to balance modernization with foreign policy independence, and what domestic pressures in 2011 led him to expand political participation?",
    "answer": "In response to domestic pressures in 2011 that called for more jobs, economic benefits, and an end to corruption, Sultan Qaboos implemented economic and political reforms, including granting Oman's legislative body more power and authorizing direct elections for its lower house. Additionally, he increased unemployment benefits and issued a royal directive for a national job creation plan. These measures aimed to decentralize authority and allow greater citizen participation in local governance, demonstrated by the successful conduct of Oman's first municipal council elections in 2012.",

    "answer": "The document does not provide sufficient information to answer the question about the total number of soldiers and police deployed across Zimbabwe during the election. However, it mentions a \"massive\" deployment of soldiers and police at most stations, but journalists disagreed with Biti's description of it as \"massive,\" so it's unclear.",
