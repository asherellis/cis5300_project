The opposition's stance was rooted in the fact that India, which has tested nuclear weapons, has declined to join international non-proliferation agreements.",

This action made the situation effectively unavoidable, with analysts, including Dennis Hranitzky, the head of sovereign litigation at law firm Quinn Emanuel, stating that a formal default was probably inevitable since March.

Changing political attitudes in Belgium contributed to the shift in support from Tutsi to Hutu leaders, ultimately contributing to Hutu resentment of minority rule.
