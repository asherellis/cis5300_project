    "answer": "Hungary, which has already secured an opt-out from the EU's embargo on Russian oil, was the only country to voice its opposition to the plan. Hungary has blamed the EU's measures for increasing prices for Hungarian drivers and households, despite having backed EU sanctions against Russia.",

    "question": "How did Oman's leadership under Sultan Qaboos manage to balance modernization with foreign policy independence, and what domestic pressures in 2011 led him to expand political participation?",
    "answer": "Oman's leadership under Sultan Qaboos implemented economic and political reforms in response to domestic pressures in 2011, which included demonstrations calling for jobs, economic benefits, and an end to corruption. As part of these reforms, Qaboos granted Oman's legislative body more power, authorized direct elections for its lower house, increased unemployment benefits, and issued a royal directive for a national job creation plan. The government also conducted its first municipal council elections in 2012, decentralizing authority and allowing greater citizen participation in local governance.",
