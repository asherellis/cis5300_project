    "answer": "The proposed civil nuclear partnership sparked opposition from the Indian opposition, who expressed concerns that India was kowtowing to the United States, and accused Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of surrendering India's sovereignty. The main opposition to the deal came from the leaders of India's two communist parties, which hold about 60 seats in Parliament. A no-confidence vote was held, which Prime Minister Singh narrowly survived, amid tensions surrounding the deal.",

    "question": "How did Russia\u2019s inability to make scheduled payments on its foreign bonds escalate into what analysts considered a default, and what specific factors\u2014including sanctions\u2014made the situation effectively unavoidable?",
    "answer": "Russia's inability to make scheduled payments on its foreign bonds escalated into what analysts considered a default due to sanctions imposed over its war in Ukraine, with the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) effectively blocking Moscow from making payments. The sanctions combined with the fact that Russia cannot borrow internationally at the moment and does not need to thanks to plentiful oil and gas export revenues made the situation effectively unavoidable. The inability to make payments was further complicated by the freezing of Russia's foreign currency and gold reserves, which Moscow had held overseas.",

Belgian administrators also increased requirements for communal labor and instituted harsh taxes, which fueled the population's frustration. Post-independence power struggles, including the shift in support from Tutsi to Hutu leaders, the overthrow of the Tutsi king in 1959, and the subsequent discrimination against Tutsis, also contributed to the escalating ethnic tensions that culminated in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.",

Human Rights Watch warned that the elections were likely to be \"deeply flawed\" due to the commission's partisan nature and limited resources. The opposition's secretary-general, Tenda Biti, also pointed to irregularities, such as the government's alleged attempt to intimidate voters by providing assistance in the voting booth, and the deployment of soldiers and police at polling stations. These concerns were especially significant given the long rule of Robert Mugabe, who has consolidated his power and presided over economic collapse, widespread poverty, and human rights abuses.",

    "question": "How was Russia using its natural gas exports as a tool of political influence over Europe in mid-2022, and what kinds of pressure did this create for EU governments, especially Germany?",
    "answer": "Russia was using its natural gas exports as a tool of political influence over Europe in mid-2022 by deliberately cutting supplies of natural gas, according to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who accused Russia of imposing a \"price terror\" against Europe. This created significant pressure for EU governments, as Zelenskiy called for more sanctions on Moscow, citing the harsh impact that reduced gas supplies would have on European countries this coming winter.",
