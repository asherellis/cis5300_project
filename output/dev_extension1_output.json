    "question": "How did Oman's leadership under Sultan Qaboos manage to balance modernization with foreign policy independence, and what domestic pressures in 2011 led him to expand political participation?",
    "answer": "Oman's leadership under Sultan Qaboos balanced modernization with foreign policy independence by prioritizing strategic ties to the UK and US, and maintaining a moderate, independent foreign policy that allowed the country to maintain good relations with its neighbors and avoid external entanglements. Domestic pressures in 2011, including popular uprisings for more jobs and economic benefits and an end to corruption, led Sultan Qaboos to expand political participation by implementing economic and political reforms, such as granting Oman's legislative body more power and authorizing direct elections for its lower house, as well as increasing unemployment benefits and implementing a national job creation plan.",
