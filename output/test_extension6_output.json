    "question": "What specific EU energy measure was scheduled to take effect according to the report, and what key details did member states agree on regarding the scope and level of gas reductions?",
    "answer": "Energy ministers from the 27 EU member states mostly backed a plan for a voluntary 15% reduction in gas usage over the winter. However, the plan included several opt-outs for island nations and countries unconnected or little connected to the European gas network, which will blunt the overall effect.",

    "question": "How did long-term political instability, recurring coups, and the emergence of northern armed groups shape Mali\u2019s struggle to maintain territorial control from 1991 through 2024?",
    "answer": "Mali's struggle to maintain territorial control was significantly impacted by a 2012 rebellion and military coup, which resulted in the expulsion of the military from the country's three northern regions and allowed terrorists to establish strongholds. A 2013 French-led military intervention managed to retake most of the north, but the government's grasp in the region remains weak. The 2015 peace accord between the Malian Government and northern rebels has seen little progress in implementation, contributing to ongoing instability.",
