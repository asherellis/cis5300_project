    "question": "What were the main political tensions surrounding India's proposed civil nuclear partnership with the United States?",
    "answer": "The main political tensions surrounding India's proposed civil nuclear partnership with the United States included opposition from India's two communist parties, who accused Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of surrendering India's sovereignty to the United States with the deal. The opposition also stemmed from concerns that India was kowtowing to the U.S., which led to a no-confidence vote against Singh. The vote was particularly crucial as it would have forced Singh to resign and required early elections unless a new coalition could have been formed.",

Prior to independence, Dominica was first a part of the British Leeward Islands and then the British Windward Islands, and in 1967, it became an associated state of the UK. In 1980, a significant political shift occurred with Mary Eugenia Charles replacing a corrupt and tyrannical administration, marking a major change in the country's governance trajectory and improving Dominica's fortunes.",

    "answer": "Russia's reduction of gas flows through Nord Stream 1 prompted a four- to sixfold rise in market prices, which may lead to a tripling of gas prices for German consumers in the coming months. German officials, including Klaus M\u00fcller and Robert Habeck, expressed concerns about the potential for Russia to completely stop gas deliveries after the pipeline's scheduled July shutdown, which could exacerbate the supply crunch. They warned that Germany may face long-term supply shortages and a high risk of not having enough gas by the end of winter or even in the autumn or winter.",

European colonial rule, primarily by Belgium, reinforced these trends, excluding Hutus from traditional positions of authority and further entrenching minority Tutsi rule, which fueled Hutu resentment. This simmering resentment eventually boiled over into violence, culminating in the 1959 overthrow of the Tutsi king and the subsequent power struggles led by Hutu leaders, including Juvenal HABYARIMANA, which ultimately contributed to the 1994 genocide.",

    "question": "How was Russia using its natural gas exports as a tool of political influence over Europe in mid-2022, and what kinds of pressure did this create for EU governments, especially Germany?",
    "answer": "According to the document, Russia was using its natural gas exports as a tool of political influence over Europe in mid-2022 by deliberately cutting supplies of natural gas to impose a \"price terror\" against Europe, as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy stated in a late-night video address. This move created pressure for EU governments, including potential emergencies such as pipeline ruptures, and led to a plan for gas savings to avoid a winter energy crisis, with energy ministers from the 27 member states agreeing to a voluntary 15% reduction in gas usage over the winter.",
