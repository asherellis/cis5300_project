    "question": "How did long-term political instability, recurring coups, and the emergence of northern armed groups shape Mali\u2019s struggle to maintain territorial control from 1991 through 2024?",
    "answer": "Mali saw 31 years of dictatorship until 1991, when a military coup led by Amadou Toumani TOURE ousted the government, but this ultimately led to a transition towards a multi-party democracy. However, a series of subsequent military coups and power struggles, including a 2012 rebellion, a 2020 military arrest of the president, and a 2021 military takeover, have contributed to ongoing instability and the struggle for territorial control in the country. In 2022, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) imposed sanctions and Mali withdrew from ECOWAS in January 2024, indicating that long-term political instability and power struggles continue to affect Mali's ability to maintain territorial control.",
